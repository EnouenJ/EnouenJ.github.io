<p>
  Rock Paper Scissors 2.0 was game born out of the following
  <a href="https://twitter.com/yujiberra/status/1132505275779338245?lang=en">
    twitter thread</a>.
    The game adds an interesting twist to the classical game and in this post
    I will discuss the game, its formulation as an MDP, the game theoretical
    solution, and an analytic dive into the best possible play.
</p>
<h3> Formulating the Game </h3>
<p>
  The game itself isn't too difficult to formulate.  We start off with three coins
  in between two players.  Each of these coins is the "rock" coin, the "paper" coin, and
  the "scissors" coin.  The two players then play a normal game of rock paper scissors.
  If one of the two players won, they slide the coin which represents the move they just
  played one space towards themself.  The players continue playing RPS and sliding coins
  until one of the players wins with the coin which is already on their side of the board.
  This player then wins the entire game.  Hopefully the picture below helps make clear
  anything this first paragraph was unable to convey:

<p>
  So, suppose on the very first turn you (being at the bottom) threw paper and
  your opponent (being at the top) threw scissors.  Then, we know that scissors
  beats paper and he moves the scissors coin closer to himself.

<p>
It is now clear that it is a much riskier move for you to throw paper again,
because then your opponent can automatically win the game by throwing scissors
and claiming the scissors coin.
On the other hand, your opponent knows this and if they knew that you would never
throw paper then they can always throw rock knowing that neither your scissors
nor your rock would be able to beat them.
This conundrum is at the heart of what makes this game interesting.
Moreover, it begs the question what is the optimal way to play in a game where
we need to balance the risk of losing with the probability of winning.
This article attempts to go into a good amount of detail in finding a sufficient
answer to this question.

<h3> Setting up the Game Theory for Optimal Play</h3>
<p>
  Let us start by investigating the ideas for the simpler game of normal rock-paper-scissors.
  We will be talking about a "mixed strategy Nash equillibirum."
  This refers to the situation where each player is allowed to use a "mixed
  strategy" which means that they can randomly decide between all of their
  potential options.
  A "Nash equillibirum" refers to a game theory concept describing a situation
  where two players, both knowing their opponent's strategy, will still opt
  for the same strategy they have previously chosen, because any change to their
  current strategy would actually leave them worse off (assuming their opponent
  also keeps the same strategy.)  When both players feel this way, the strategies
  are at a Nash equillibirum.
  When each of those strategies are allowed to be random choices as we just described,
  then altogether we arrive at a "mixed strategy Nash equillibirum."
  So, in the context of RPS, we are looking for each player's probability of throwing
  rock, paper, or scissors if they are able to know their opponent's strategy beforehand.
  If you have thought about this problem before it becomes pretty obvious that the
  best strategy is to throw each with probability $1/3$ because for instance if you
  threw rock with probability 1/2 then your opponent could just choose to throw paper always
  and they would instantly have a 50% chance or greater of beating you.
  Let us go through the math of this problem with the following utility table:
</p>

<p>
So the equations then become $\alpha+\beta$

<h3> Framing the Problem as an MDP</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have a good idea of how to solve this kind of problem in general,
  let us make some progress on our original problem by formulating the exact
  problem a little more rigorously. We will do this in a language very similar
  to that of a Markov Decision Process or MDP.
