<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I am a 1st year PhD student at University of Southern California
studying Machine Learning and Data Science.
I graduated from The Ohio State University with a double major in
Computer Science and Mathematics.
I have previously done research in pure math, primarily in finite combinatorics.
Currently, most of my research focuses on marrying the statistically grounded methods from
<b>machine learning</b> with the impressive representational power of <b>deep neural networks</b>.

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
The essence of my research direction as it currently stands is to make sense of the amazing
power of deep neural networks.  I am approaching this problem from a variety of different
perspectives including interpretability, information theory, dynamical systems,
generalizability, and statistical validity.
My research statement and current directions can be viewed <a href="../research"> here</a>.
