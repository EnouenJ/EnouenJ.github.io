About Me
</p>
<p>
I am a 4th year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University.
I will be graduating in May 2020 with an Honors Bachelors of Science
with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.
I have done research in some combinatorics including graph theory and
knot theory, but now my interest lies primarily with artificial intelligence.
The main research I have done currently is investigating the trade-off between
specificity and accuracy in the context of computer vision.
